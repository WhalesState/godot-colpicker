# Features:
it has two colors Primary/Secondary , left mouse button will change the primary color and right mouse button will change the secondary color but also you can use it with only one color by disabling the secondary color.
can be resized to a minimum of 96x144.

# New updates will include :
buttons will show a popup allowing to change HEX/RGBA/HSV or copy the color.
will add a hex value editor and a screen color picker which will work the same way LMB to pick primary color and RMB to pick Secondary color.
will add presets on top of color picker and make it optional.

# The code needs some clean-up but it works fine and optimized for performance.
